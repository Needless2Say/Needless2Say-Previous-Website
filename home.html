                <p class="about_me">I am a Rising Junior at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Applied Statistics and Japanese. I am interested in full stack development and I am currently making my own website that includes a Front-End, API, and Back-End. I am looking for an internship in Software Engineering / Full Stack Development. This past Winter Semester 2023, I took EECS 281 and EECS 370, and Japanese 126 at The University of Michigan Ann Arbor. EECS 281 is Data Structures and Algorithms, EECS 370 is Computer Architecture. EECS 281 and EECS 370 will help me prepare for demanding project deadlines because I have to balance 3-4 projects at a time that are due in around 2-3 weeks after the projects are released.</p>
